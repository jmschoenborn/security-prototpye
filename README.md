# Welcome to the CBR security prototype using SEASALT

The project has been uploaded as a .war project. You will need a (local-) server such as Apache Tomcat to run the web project on. 
Additionally, there are two traffic export files created by Burp and Wireshark to test the program. 

For any comments, feel free to contact me.
